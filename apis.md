description: Pirate Metrics is an API that tracks metrics important to subscription-based
  businesses, such as new user signups and activity, and provides marketing advice
  for improving user retention and driving more revenue.This application delivers
  actionable analytics and marketing insight for SaaS applications. Based on the famous
  Startup Metrics for Pirates talk by Dave McClure, Pirate Metrics tracks Acquisitions
  (new user signups) Activations (a user uses your product) Retentions (a user continues
  to use your product) Referrals (a user refers other users) and Revenue (a user pays
  for your service.)By tracking these key events, Pirate Metrics can search for patterns
  in your subscribers&#8217; behavior, and then suggest a course of action for improving
  your user retention rate and driving more revenue.
